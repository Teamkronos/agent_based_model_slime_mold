# Topic: Optimising transport networks under consideration of population density and topography using a slime mold inspired agent based model
* This paper will introduce an agent-based model to mimic the foraging behaviour of the slime mold species Physarum Polycephalum to optimise road networks in Oâ€™ahu (Hawaii, USA) and Hokkaido (Japan) under the influence of elevation and population. 
* Our findings are consistent across these maps and demonstrate that the addition of both factors will lead to more optimal and realistic solutions. 
* It was found that elevation has a significantly stronger effect on the shape of road networks than city population. 
* Supported by biological experiments, we justify that an agent based model may substitute the use of real slime mold samples when modeling transport networks. 
* This is relevant to the modelling of existing and future planned transport networks as well as other network related problems. 
* We suggest that our model may be applied to archeological research or biomedicine and offer extensions for future development of our model in a 3D environment.
